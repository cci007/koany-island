**Description:**

Congrats, your tests have passed! Your test results were exported to `~/project/results/test_results.xml`. Let's see if you can display the test results in the _test summary_ tab, and export the file as an _artifact_ in case we want to inspect it later.

**Goals:**

- Get a green build
- Have test results displayed in the _test summary_ tab
- Export the test results to an artifact.
- Share link to green job.
